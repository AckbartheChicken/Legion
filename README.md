# Legion
Legion, a 2d, top down, simplistic game engine.

Legion is the second version of a game engine I wrote, initially called "Engine".
Due to sloppy writing, a lack of planning, and difficulty changing fundamental aspects of Engine,
I decided to do a rewrite, rather than try and do a huge amount of editing a not super small project (It also wasn't actually that big, but I am a bit of a noob).
I have reused a lot of the structure and code, but some of the basic structure is different, and I handle some problems very differently.
It is going very well so far, and I have already managed to fix some of the problems I was worried about in Engine.
Also, if you want to use this project, download legion_main.py and legion_func.py, and then run legion_main.py
You also need pygame installed to run it.
Then you just run legion_main.py using python.

Refer to docs.txt for more in depth descriptions of the engine/data structures and how it works.
